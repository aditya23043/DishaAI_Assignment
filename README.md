# DishaAI Assignment (Tasks Application)

## Deployed Link (added on 2025-05-20 00:06)
- https://dishaai2023043.netlify.app/

## How to run?

```
cd dnd/
npm run preview
```

- Now go to `https://localhost:4173` (by default vite chooses port 4173 to host the website)

## Progress
- Frontend part fully completed
- Not able to integrate with the backend
- I coded up the backend in C using web sockets and Linux syscalls earlier (https://github.com/aditya23043/C_web_server)
- Since I was not able to integrate the frontend, I was not able to fully deploy the website
