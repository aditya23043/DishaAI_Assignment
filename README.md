# DishaAI Assignment (Tasks Application)

## How to run?

```
cd dnd/
npm run dev
```

- Now go to `https://localhost:5173` (by default vite chooses port 5173 to host the website)

## Progress
- Frontend part fully completed
- Not able to integrate with the backend
- I coded up the backend in C using web sockets and Linux syscalls earlier (https://github.com/aditya23043/C_web_server)
